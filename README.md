### redux-toolkit
#### A very basic dummy application with psuedo code notes created to be a something I can reference back to when I work with Redux Toolkit in a React app 
* For basic use of one slice refer to the counterSlice in /store/index and how it works inside the Counter component 
* the rest of the application is basically one giant reference w notes to creating more than one slice and sharing the data
